# Kubernetes Architecture
From a high level, a Kubernetes environment/cluster consists of a control plane (master), and a number of worker nodes (slaves)

# Kubernetes Control Plane
The control plane is the system that maintains a record of all Kubernetes objects. It continuously manages object states, responding to changes in the cluster; it also works to make the actual state of system objects match the desired state. As the above illustration shows, the control plane is made up of three major components: kube-apiserver, kube-controller-manager and kube-scheduler. These can all run on a single master node, or can be replicated across multiple master nodes for high availability.

# Worker Nodes
Worker nodes are machines that run containers and are managed by the master nodes. The Kubelet is the primary and most important controller in Kubernetes. Itâ€™s responsible for driving the container execution layer.
